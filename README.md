# Mathieu-11-element-list
A list of all elements in the Mathieu group 11 as a permutation representation of the group.

Link to file: https://github.com/r-a-jones/Mathieu-11-element-list/blob/main/M11.txt

The file contains a list of $7920$ permutations, which when together with permutation composition, makes a group isomorphic to $M_{11}$, the smallest sporadic simple group.

In the file, $e$ denotes the identity permutation.
